## Utils

I have also created a python script to delpoy the application in pythonanywhere

**NOTE**: Run the script after pushing the code to your git repository 

#### Prerequisite

- Account in [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com)

Now Run [deploy.py](deploy.py) script using the below code

```
